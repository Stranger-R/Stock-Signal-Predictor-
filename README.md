# Stock-Signal-Predictor-
This project is a Python-based stock analysis tool that predicts buy and sell signals based on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover strategy. It primarily uses the 50-day and 200-day EMAs to detect bullish (Golden Cross) and bearish (Death Cross) signals in historical stock data
